<#
.SYNOPSIS
Removes accounts and their stored passwords.

.DESCRIPTION
The `Remove-MailAccount` function removes accounts from accounts.json and deletes their passwords
from the Windows Credential Manager (or, on Linux and macOS, their password files). If the default
account is removed, there is no default account afterwards, and Send-Mail goes back to the SMTP_*
environment variables. A SMTP_PASS_<NAME> environment variable is not touched.

.PARAMETER Name
The names of the accounts, or wildcard patterns. Also taken from the pipeline, as names or as the
accounts listed by Get-MailAccount.

.EXAMPLE
Remove-MailAccount old

.EXAMPLE
Get-MailAccount test* | Remove-MailAccount -WhatIf

Shows which accounts would be removed, without removing them.

.EXAMPLE
Remove-MailAccount *

Removes every account and its stored password, so Send-Mail reads the SMTP_* environment variables
again.
